# asterisk
asterisk is a raycasting game made using SDL2.

this is a learning project and is clearly far from finished.
the plan is not to build a fully playable game.

for now I will pause the development due to time issues - maybe one day I will continue.


# Building

The project uses CMake.
If you're on Windows, simply download the SDL2 library and extract it somewhere in your drive.
Then using CMake-GUI, indicate the path to SDL2 and generate the project files.

The project relies on third party libraries :
- glm
- spdlog
- stb_image
- sdl2_image (not necessary)
